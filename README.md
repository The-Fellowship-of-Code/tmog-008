# The Mirror of Galadriel!
## Episode #008 - Binary Search

Welcome to ***The Mirror of Galadriel***, one of the activities that will follow in the *The Fellowship of Code*. If you haven't been here before, this is a place where programming problems of different types will be proposed to be solved as fast as possible.

Without further ado, we leave you with the next problem. 

Good luck adventurers!

## Statement

Given an array of integers ``nums`` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer ``target``, write a function to search ``target`` in ``nums``. If ``target`` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with ``O(log n)`` runtime complexity.

***Constraints***
> 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
> </br> -10^4 < nums[i], target < 10^4
> </br> All the integers in ``nums`` are unique.
> </br> ``nums`` is sorted in ascending order.

## Examples

*Example 1*
> **Input**: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
> </br> **Output**: 4
> </br> **Explanation**: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4

*Example 2*
> **Input**: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
> </br> **Output**: -1
> </br> **Explanation**: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1

## Extra

Run, you fools! No extra spicy stuff this time.
